# ics-holiday-parser

Ics Holiday Parser is a lightweight Python script that reads public ICS calendar files and extracts only the events you care about. Specifically, it can:

Filter national holidays from a full calendar containing holidays, observances, and other events.

Separate commemorative days (non-official holidays) for easier reference.

Automatically generate a new ICS file containing only the filtered events.

Be integrated into automated workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions) for daily updates.

This tool is ideal for developers, organizations, or anyone who wants a clean, up-to-date calendar of Taiwan’s official holidays and commemorative days.
